# Royal Family Merger

- Why are we doing this? To play with more active folks and get freebies! Renegade Empire has been great, but it has been stagnating a bit.
  Sad, I know, time to move on...
- Message in alliance chat or to Pepin or Cecily directly to let us know your response for merger (e.g. Yes I will merge with Royal Family) or for any comments/opinions.

## Phase 1

- 6 players to move around June 24th after Alliance Siege event ends

(stats were taken sometime June 20)

## Phase 2

- Room for 3 players when Royal Family moves to next alliance level.
- So 3 of these will move.
- Let's hope that maybe there will be more room at this timing. So maybe more than 3 can move...
- Not sure of exact timing yet.

## Phase 3 and Beyond

- Unfortunately some people have fallen here because -> inactivity, new to the team, or secondary characters
- Maybe stay in Renegade. Maybe move to another alliance if there is room such as Petty Kings
- Maybe can go phase 2 if there is more room
