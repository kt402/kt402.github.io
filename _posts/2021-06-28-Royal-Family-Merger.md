## Phase 2

- Room for 3 players when Royal Family moves to next alliance level. So 3 of these will move. Not sure of exact timing yet. Subject to change, if more openings occur earlier.
- I've listed in priority order, subject to change based on whether responded, activeness, alliance contributions, etc. 
- Let's hope that maybe there will be more room at this timing. So maybe more than 3 can move...
